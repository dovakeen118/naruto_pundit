# Naruto Pundit

This application is an example of how to implement the Pundit Ruby gem for user authorization.\
The `master` branch is a work in progress to incorporate new technologies.\
The `starter-code` branch does not include Pundit - it is where you can start to add your roles for authorization.\
The `launch-run` branch includes Pundit policies for only Users.\
The `add-user-roles` branch includes Pundit policies for both Users and Missions.
